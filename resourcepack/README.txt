These resource pack versions are not up-to-date with the current model and have
issues. Do not use them! If you want a resource pack version, you will need to
update them yourself with the model and textures sourced from the
src/resources/assets/minecraft directory.

Note that the 2d_icon_with_shader uses a special core shader and evil tricks to
make the 3D model have a 2D icon in the inventory.
